What does Eng.QA do

Eng.QA has both TW and AQA (Java/C##) ICs

1. Pick few stable products with a lot of E2Es
2. Rewrite as much E2Es as possible in Gherkin language (TW)
3. Run/Execute them in Behave/aureacentral - move E2E to TW->(Execution->AutomationPending->In Automation->Coding->PassAutomation->)DONE
Per week you will be expected to (re)write X number of E2Es
